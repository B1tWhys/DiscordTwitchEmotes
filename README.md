# Add Twitch.tv emotes to your Discord server for added Dankness!
This directory is all you need to add most twitch emotes to your channel! It doesn't include all emotes because you only have 50 emoji to play with. This has the 45 dankest, spiciest, and most flavorful of the twitch emotes, but if you want a complete set of all twitch emotes, you will either have to either have a twitch partnership, or you and you friends will need to switch to [better discord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/).
